This is a very simple web project skeleton.
Importable in Eclipse (see .project file)
Uses 
  -jQuery 2.x
  -css.browser.selector By Raphael Lima (to target browser specific layouting issues in CSS)
  -John Resig's Simple JavaScript inheritance script (provides basic class inheritance in JS)
  -Normalize.css (by Nicholas Gallagher): Provides common bootstrap for layout and Look & Feel of HTML nodes in different browsers.

Provides a basic Ajax example by fetching a list of employees on a button click.

It serves as a startup to try simle separate POC features in an isolated manner.

Enjoy.
